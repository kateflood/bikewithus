Bike With Us

A crowd sourced way to find the best bike route around town. 

Obviously, this is still way in progress and will continue to be a side project until I have more time to dedicate to it. Conceptually, this a mobile ready app that will help people find the most commonly used bike route in town (I'm in Portland so that is where I'm starting.) Yes, there is Strata, but this looking to be more for the occassional bike rider or someone looking to start commuting - not for the avid cyclist.

So, users will either find a ride by entering in two points in town and the app will display all the routes people have added between those areas (with the idea being that the most popular will pop out in some sort of heat mapp-y kind of way) OR you can add a new route by recording your ride so that other folks can see how you go.

I have additionaly dreams of ratings, adding more meta information like hills, difficult crossings, etc.


What I'm using:

Rails app using Bourbon/Neat/Bitters with some adjustments. JS to collect location data.

Eventually, postgres and heroku when I get to the point I want to push it into some demo status.
